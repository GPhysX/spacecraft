OPEN-SESSAME Framework Version 1.0

IMPORTANT: I am looking for feedback on users of Open-SESSAME. I see that there has been a lot of download activity on the sourceforge webpage. If you have downloaded Open-SESSAME, and are giving it a try *PLEASE* send me an email regarding your usage and what you are planning to do with it. Development has currently paused as I don't know who is using Open-SESSAME and what features they would like to use.

Please read INSTALL for compilation instructions.

The latest version of the Open-Sessame Framework can be obtained at
  http://spacecraft.sourceforge.net/

There are two mailing lists
  spacecraft-users@lists.sourceforge.net
  spacecraft-develop@lists.sourceforge.net

please follow the link in

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/spacecraft

to subscribe to the lists or to visit the archives.

Enjoy,
